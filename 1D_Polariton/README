2. BEFORE BEGINING
################################

Before to attempt some calculus with the package, you need some programs and libraries installed in your system.
All the scripts *.py run over python 2.7.x, and all the *.ipynb run over ipython notebook 1.2.x.
Some additional packages for python are: numpy, scipy and  matplotlib.
Graficos2D.ipynb need some video codec  installed to make the animations.

For Windows I advise to install anaconda from , it is a bundle with all the necessary things
