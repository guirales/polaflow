# Derivatives #

There are several ways of define a numerical derivative of a function, in this project we will use the  concept of central derivative at several dots, to solve the Laplacian operator in the Schr√∂dinger equation in any coordinate system; then is necessary to develop all, the even and odd, derivatives at any order.
