# Introduction #

The POLAFLOW project is a European Commission funded research grant (ERC) that studies experimentally and theoretically the physics of ligth-matter coupling in semiconductor microcavities. As part of the research effort, the group has developed numerical codes to integrate the wavefunction of the polaritons to simulate the experiment, taking into account the chief ingredients of the polariton physics, which are:

  * Polariton effect: non-parabolic dispersion.
  * Dimensionality: 1D and/or 2D.
  * Out-of-equilibrium: dissipation and pumping.
  * Nonlinearities: particles self-interactions.
  * Defects: excitonic and/or photonic potentials.

The computer code, under the codename **polaflow**, is released under the GPL3 for the greater good of the community at large. The release is still under construction, and can be tracked through its various [versions](versions.md).
